## (Dis)similarities in the use of musical dimensions and musica features between and within 22 European countries

Music is believed to be "universal." Hence, if music is universal, what distinguishes one culture's music from another, and why is music perceived as dissimilar when two or more cultures are compared, despite the fact that musical components such as tempo, pitch, and rhythm are used consistently across cultures?

Numerous plausible explanations have been proposed, with biological and cultural explanations dominating in recent decades. Traditionally, cross-cultural research aimed at identifying (dis)similarities (either manually or computationally) has concentrated on biological or cultural aspects. However, because music is neither a cultural nor a biological product, linking biological (individual neurobiological variability and its impact, up to the population level) and cultural differences in understanding of musical diversity could help better explain musical diversity. 

There are currently no studies examining the (dis)similarities between and within countries in terms of how musical dimensions and features are understood and used in genres thought to reflect culture (folk songs, children's folk songs, and children's songs). Therefore, a recent research has investigated the cross-cultural (dis)similarities in musical dimensions and features across three genres, folk songs, children's folk songs, and children's songs, in 22 European countries considered to be geographically close or with similar political/historical/economic/cultural backgrounds.
