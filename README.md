**INTRODUCTION - FROM SOUND TO COLOR**


*Sound and color are like the twin flames of perception, dancing together to create the poetry of existence.*
                                                                                                        

What was in the Beginning of all Beginnings? Sound or light?  The third verse of Genesis contains the earliest documented reference to sound: "And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and light appeared.”  Thus, God spoke (there was sound), and thereafter was light, and presumably some color of (visible) light. Notwithstanding the global diversity and complexity of the world we live in, various civilizations not only possess distinct conceptions of sound but also regard it as a fundamental component in the universe's formation. In India, for example, sound has consistently had a distinct purpose throughout history and continues to be associated with God known as “Sound”. 

The question is why the emphasis is on sound? The prioritization of sound above color in the evolutionary chronology of human experiences is based on the underlying mechanisms by which our senses have evolved and operated throughout history. Evolutionary biology indicates that humans most likely developed the ability to hear before they developed the ability to see. Primitive humans, similar to other creatures, greatly depended on their auditory perception for their existence. The capacity to perceive and comprehend auditory stimuli played a vital role in detecting potential threats, engaging in social interactions with other individuals within the community, and locating essential resources such as food and water. Acoustic signals conveyed crucial data about the surroundings, enabling early people to efficiently move and adapt to diverse circumstances.

On the other hand, although color vision is an essential component of human perception, it is possible that it developed and improved at a later stage in the process of evolution. Primitive humans presumably had a less developed color vision compared to contemporary humans, as the capacity to perceive different colors became beneficial for distinguishing ripe fruits, evaluating the condition of plants, and detecting potential dangers. 
Hence, the notion that sound was the initial sensory experience for humans is based on the evolutionary importance of auditory awareness for survival. As people underwent evolution and their surroundings grew more intricate, the acquisition of color vision became progressively advantageous for comprehending and engaging with the world in novel manners. It is very true that auditory and visual perception are essential aspects of the human experience, however, the evolutionary history suggests that sound could play a crucial role in the early stages of human development.

At some point, some individuals in ancient times may asked themselves not only “what was in the very beginning,” sound or color, but also how sound and color are related. As an example, the Greek philosopher, Pythagoras, directed his attention predominantly towards the mathematical intricacies of musical intervals. However, later interpretations and sources indicate that he may have delved into more extensive correlations among mathematics, sound, and probably color. 

Sir Isaac Newton, renowned for his research into light, categorized the dispersion of light into spectral components, specifically seven colors (violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red). This early portrayal of the chromaticity diagram was a significant contribution to the field. Newton, in his calculations of wavelength, intriguingly paired these seven spectral components/colors with seven musical notes, starting with note D (representing red color) and concluding with note D:

Newton was motivated by music to expand on the traditional "rainbow" concept, which originally consisted of only five colors. He introduced two additional colors, orange, and indigo, to align the colors with the structure of a musical scale (for further details, refer to Newton's book Opticks, published in 1730). 
In the centuries that followed, not only did advances in empirical observation, experiments, and the formalization of scientific methodologies facilitate systematic investigation into the correlation between sound and color, but it also continued to be an intriguing and interdisciplinary subject captivating philosophers, writers, scientists, and artists to examine the interdependencies of visual and auditory stimuli. This resulted in an extensive corpus of literature, research, and discourse, as well as a deeper understanding of the scientific principles underlying the correlation between color and sound.  

If the question "What was in the Beginning of all Beginnings?"—whether it be sound or color—is not resolved, then another question can be asked. Why would somebody be interested in making a connection between color and sound?

It is important to note that the connection between color and sound goes beyond simply appreciating beauty, and delves into the fields of psychology, art, science, and even education. The investigation of color and sound, whether through artistic representation, or scientific investigation, reveals a complex network of connections that enrich our comprehension of perception and the interaction between several senses.

Within the domain of art and design, the notion of color harmony and its analogous counterparts in music composition underscores the fundamental correlations between color and sound. Both visual and auditory stimuli elicit emotional reactions, and artists frequently utilize this common emotional language to create immersive and influential experiences. The use of vibrant and bright colors can be compared to lively and upbeat musical compositions, while colder tones can create a feeling of quiet and tranquility, reflecting the relaxing qualities of specific sounds.

From a scientific perspective, the physics of color and sound are characterized by shared principles, including wavelength and frequency. The visible light spectrum contains a range of colors, whereas the auditory spectrum includes numerous sound frequencies. This comparison prompts intriguing discussions about how these two sensory modalities are alike or different in terms of perception. 

From an educational perspective, some colors and sounds contribute to creating a more conducive learning environment. Employing a multiple-sensory approach to teaching implies understanding that specific colors can enhance cognitive functioning, while particular sounds foster concentration and engagement. Whether it is through interactive visual aids, color-coded notes, or educational applications that incorporate auditory cues, students are benefiting from the evolving understanding of how sensory elements can contribute to a richer and more immersive learning experience.

Fourteen students from School Center Novo Mesto, SGLVŠ, involved in Music expression course, and sixteen students involved in Art expression course in the "JANUS" exhibition were also motivated by this principle. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the majority of these students to investigate the close relationship between color and sound. By utilizing science, art, and artificial intelligence to generate musical compositions based on the colors extracted from Merlin's images for this exhibition, they have demonstrated the vital importance of providing students with opportunities for inspiration, creativity, and the exploration of their imagination.

**Sound to Pictures** explores the sound behind pictures; *images are converted into algorithmic musical pieces*.

It is an integral part of the JANUS project, the objective of which is to convert eight images, contributed by the well-known Slovenian painter and musician Lenart Merlin, into sound by analyzing their color palette and applying various AI techniques.

By experimenting with diverse sound combinations, algorithmic musical compositions were produced in collaboration with a group of students enrolled at School center Novo mesto, SGLVŠ, Novo mesto, Slovenia, in accordance with the emotions (e.g., fear, sorrow, joy, and anger) evoked by the eight images.

The brief excerpts (approximately 20 seconds) from these musical compositions, that were subsequently utilized in a research study and a survey are provided below.

**Sound to Pictures** raziskuje zvok za slikami; *slike se pretvarjajo v algoritemske glasbene kompozicije*.

Je sestavni del projekta JANUS, katerega cilj je pretvoriti osem slik, ki jih je prispeval znani slovenski slikar in glasbenik Lenart Merlin, v zvok s pomočjo analize njihove barvne palete in uporabo različnih tehnik umetne inteligence.

S preizkušanjem raznolikih zvočnih kombinacij so v sodelovanju s skupino dijakov Šolskega centra Novo mesto, SGLVŠ, Novo mesto, vključenih v izbirni predmet glasbeno izražanje, nastale algoritemske glasbene kompozicije v skladu s čustvi (npr. strah, žalost, veselje, jeza). ki jih prikliče osem podob.

Kratki odlomki (približno 20 sekund) iz teh glasbenih skladb, ki so bili pozneje uporabljeni v raziskovalni študiji in anketi, so navedeni spodaj.
