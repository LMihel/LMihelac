"Sound to Pictures" explores the sound behind pictures; images are converted into algorithmic musical pieces.

It is an integral part of the JANUS project, the objective of which is to convert eight images, contributed by the well-known Slovenian painter and musician Lenart Merlin, into sound by analyzing their color palette and applying various AI techniques.

By experimenting with diverse sound combinations, algorithmic musical compositions were produced in collaboration with a group of students enrolled at School center Novo mesto, SGLVÅ , Novo mesto, Slovenia, in accordance with the emotions (e.g., fear, sorrow, joy, and anger) evoked by the eight images.

The brief excerpts (approximately 20 seconds) from these musical compositions, that were subsequently utilized in a research study and a survey are provided below.
